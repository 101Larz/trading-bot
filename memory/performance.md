## Market-Open Log — 2026-05-21 (Thursday)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Routine | Market-Open Execution (9:46 ET) |
| Cash | $100,000.00 |
| Equity | $100,000.00 |
| Open Positions | 0 / 6 |
| Trades This Week | 0 / 3 |
| Decision | **NO_TRADE** |

Buy-rule check: positions 0/6 ✅ · weekly trades 0/3 ✅ · ≤20% equity/position ✅ · catalyst in RESEARCH-LOG ✅ (MSFT primary, GOOGL secondary).

Decision rationale:
- Entry criteria unverifiable: `market_data.py` returns only 1 bar for MSFT/GOOGL/SPY → MA20/MA50/RSI-14 all `null`. Strategy criteria #1 (price > MA20 & MA50) and #2 (RSI 40–65) cannot be confirmed. Pre-market plan explicitly required RSI 40–65 on a ≥20-bar live snapshot — condition fails.
- `trade.py` has no `buy` subcommand (CLI: `clock|open|orders|cancel-all|close`). No documented execution path; not patching trading infrastructure during a live routine.
- Live quotes benign — no tech-rotation gap-down: MSFT ask $423 (vs plan $422.11), GOOGL ask $386.24 (vs plan $389.88), SPY $738.10.
- Default under unverifiable entry criteria is NO_TRADE. Capital preserved at full cash.

Trades executed: **none.**

|--------|-----|-----------|---------|----------------|
| AAPL | 1 | $301.88 | $304.53 | +$2.65 (+0.88%) |

Notes: First position of the week. AAPL 1 sh opened @ $301.88 avg entry; 10% trailing-stop GTC active (order 5851cbb5, stop $274.99, HWM $305.54). Day P&L driven entirely by AAPL mark-up. Cash reserve 99.7% of equity — comfortably within the ≥20% rule and the 5% single-position cap. Trade was entered after the market-open routine, which had logged NO_TRADE at 09:46 ET. Flat-to-green day; no risk limits approached.

## Market-Open Log — 2026-05-22 (Friday)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Routine | Market-Open Execution (09:46 ET) |
| Cash (pre-trade) | $99,698.12 |
| Equity (pre-trade) | $100,005.54 |
| Open Positions | 1 → 2 / 6 |
| Trades This Week | 1 → 2 / 3 |
| Decision | **TRADE — GOOGL** |

Buy-rule check: positions 1/6 ✅ · weekly trades 1/3 ✅ · ≤20% equity/position ✅ (~4.6%) · catalyst in today's RESEARCH-LOG ✅ (GOOGL primary).

Entry-criteria re-validation (live, 60-bar snapshot):
- GOOGL: price $385.83 > MA20 $383.55 & MA50 $339.55 (bullish) ✅ · RSI-14 51.48 in 40–65 band ✅ · tight spread (bid 385.72 / ask 385.83) ✅ · SPY $742.72 > MA20 $730.0 (macro filter OK) ✅ · no negative 48h catalyst ✅. No gap-down vs pre-market plan.
- COST: **rejected.** RSI 60 / bullish MAs passed, but (a) quote spread unusable/stale (bid $984.20 / ask $1,092 vs $1,050 mark) and (b) Costco fiscal Q3 earnings land ~May 28–29 — within 5 trading days. Strategy bars entry into the earnings window.

Trade executed:
| Symbol | Side | Qty | Est. Price | Est. Value | Order ID |
|--------|------|-----|-----------|-----------|----------|
| GOOGL | BUY | 12 | $390.00 | $4,680.00 | a543b11b-59fe-4fad-84d2-fd0d545e3c78 |

Sizing: floor(($100,005.54 × 0.05) / $386.79 limit) = 12 shares. 10% trailing-stop GTC placed immediately after fill (order a7fadae9, stop $347.157, HWM $385.73). Weekly buys remaining: 1.

Position-management note — AAPL: RSI-14 still extremely overbought (~82). Tiny 1-share position protected by a 10% trailing stop; flagged for the end-of-day routine to consider a full exit per the "RSI > 75" exit rule.

| GOOGL | 12 | $385.82 | $383.24 | -$30.99 (-0.67%) |

Notes: Flat-to-slightly-red day; Day P&L -$26.96 driven by GOOGL marking down -$30.99 after entry, partially offset by AAPL +$6.68. Both positions carry 10% trailing-stop GTC orders. Cash reserve $95,068.28 = 95.1% of equity — well within the ≥20% cash rule; total exposure 4.9%. No risk limits approached (daily loss limit 3% not remotely close). AAPL RSI-14 remains overbought (>75) — carried into the weekend; re-evaluate for exit at Monday's pre-market routine. 2 of 3 weekly trades used.
